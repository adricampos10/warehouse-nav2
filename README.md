# warehouse-nav2

I'm building an autonomous warehouse robot with **ROS 2 Jazzy + Nav2**, simulated in **Gazebo Harmonic** (and later NVIDIA Isaac Sim), with a **behavior-tree mission** and an **automated scenario test suite** that runs headless in Docker and on GitHub Actions.

> Work in progress.

## What I'm building
- Differential-drive robot navigating a warehouse with Nav2.
- Mission logic as a behavior tree: go to a shelf, wait, return, recover if blocked.
- Scenario suite (moving obstacles, narrow aisles, people crossing) run headless in Docker, reporting success rate, time to goal and minimum obstacle distance.
- CI with GitHub Actions running the scenarios on every change.

## Docs
- [Command cheatsheet](docs/cheatsheet.md) — the Docker, ROS 2 and Git commands I use, explained.
- [Diagrams](docs/diagrams/README.md) — how the project is put together.

## Run the environment
```bash
docker build -t warehouse-nav2:jazzy docker/
docker run --rm -it warehouse-nav2:jazzy bash
```
